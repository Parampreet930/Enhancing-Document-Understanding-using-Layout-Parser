Document Understanding with Layout Parser

Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing document understanding through layout parsing techniques. It provides a systematic approach to interpret various document layouts, including text, images, and tables, leveraging the Layout Parser library.

Installation
To run this code, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required dependencies using pip:


!pip install -U layoutparser
!pip install layoutparser[ocr]
!pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git@v0.4#egg=detectron2'
!pip install pycocotools

 Usage
1. Load COCO annotations and images.
2. Define a color map for different content types (text, image, table, etc.).
3. Utilize layout parsing techniques to extract structured information from documents.
4. Visualize the parsed layout with color-coded boundaries for each content type.

 Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive solution for document understanding, enabling efficient extraction of structured information from unstructured documents. It facilitates improved data interpretation and analysis for various applications, including information retrieval, data mining, and document automation. 

For detailed usage instructions and code documentation, refer to the inline comments and Layout Parser documentation.
